.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program looks-up the definition of a term. It supports a number of definition
sources. In this version they are an acronyms database and a filename suffixes
database.

Like the 
.Nx 1.5
version of 
.Nm , this version will ignore an 
.Dq is 
given on the command line, allowing the more natural usage:
.Nm 
.Ar is
.Ar wtf .

Like
.Xr man ,
.Nm 
will display all matches found when the 
.Fl a
flag is given on the command line.

The 
.Nm wtfindex
program builds an index of the entries in
.Ar filename .
This index is written to
.Ar filename.dat .
.Ar filename
must contain a series of lines. Each line should consist of a key (the term
being defined) and a value (the definition) separated by a single tab
character, and should be terminated by a newline character. 

The 
.Nm wtfdump
program lists the entries in 
.Ar filename 
in ascending order.


.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width DATADIR -compact
.It Pa DATADIR
System-wide directory to search for data files.

.It Pa $HOME/.wtf
User specific directory to search for data files.

.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width WTFPATH -compact
.It Pa WTFPATH
Semi-colon delimited list of directories to be searched.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fortune 6 ,
.Xr whatis 1 ,
.Xr wtf 6 ,
.Xr sort 1

.Sh BUGS
The index files are not transportable across machines of different endian-ness
and/or with different sizes of 
.Ar unsigned long .

The command-line argument handling code is very rudimentary.

No doubt there are a great many more. If you find any, please squash them and
send the pieces to the author.

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm 
first appeared in 
.Nx 1.5 .
.br
This version of 
.Nm
was created on Slackware Linux 9.0.0
