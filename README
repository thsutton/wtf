README for wtf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program is intended to be a replacement for the wtf(6) command found on
NetBSD (1.5+), Slackware Linux and possibly others. It is written in C and
uses a binary index file somewhat similar, conceptually at least, to that used
by strfile(8) and fortune(6).

It supports multiple databases and user specific directories and will search
each database in its both data directories until it runs out of databases or
finds a match.

The index builder in this version no longer requires the text datafiles to be
presorted.

It SHOULD be relatively stable and bug free, but is not yet finished and has
NOT been audited for bugs and security holes. This version is it-works-for-me
quality software.

There is not reason to install this software SUID/SGID. Indeed to do so would
be foolhardy in the extreme.

Please read the notices in the COPYRIGHT file as it contains important
information which may affect the distribution of this package or parts
thereof.

Any comments, suggestions or patches are welcome at the address specified in
the AUTHORS file.
