TODO for wtf
============

The following items are in semi-order of importance:

- Make the indexer work properly on empty files.

- Make the argument handling code in `wtf.c` work properly.

- Clean up code. It's all rather messy.

- Fix/add and test bounds checking on I/O operations, especially seeking.

- Use autoconf and automake?
